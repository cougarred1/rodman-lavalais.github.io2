/**
 * OPERATORS
 * 
 * 0. Operators are symbols that are used in our code to perform operations. These operations can 
 * be anything from comparing, to summing, diving and so much more.
 * 
 * 1. Assignment Operators:assign a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand
 * 
 * 2. Arithmetic: takes two operands and perform a calculation based on the symbol used
 * 
 * 3. Comparison: Compare numbers or strings and perform evaluations. Returning either 1 or 0 representing
 true or false.
 * 
 * 4. Logical: Used to determine the logic between variables or values. Evaluating expressions returning 
  whether the expression is true or false. 
 * 
 * 5. Unary: Operators working on only one value.
 * 
 * 
 * 6. Ternary: a condition evaluated that takes three operands. An expression that has a outcome
 based on whether true or false
 *

  // Assignment Operator:
  // Operations used with =, +=, -=, etc
  m = 10

  //Arithmatic: +, -, *, %, etc
  4 + 2

// Comparison: ==, > !=, etc
5 > 2

//Logical: &&, !!, !

(5 > 2) && (5 > 3)

//Unary: tyepof, delete

typeof "hello";

//Ternary: 

win? console.log("You Win!") : console.log("You Lose!")
